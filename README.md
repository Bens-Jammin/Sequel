# Sequel

Sequel is a project I began working on during the Summer after my second year in university (May 2024), as a way to improve my understanding of how databases worked. <br>
I didn't learn much from my databases I class, so I spent some of my free time in the summer to make a function (albeit terrible) database program, and planned on improving <br>
and optimizing the design during my databases II class.

It's called Sequel because a lot of the major design ideas (query names, etc) were heavily inspired by SQL, and I thought it would be funny if I could pretend that it was the *sequel* to SQL. 

## How to Implement 
add to your `cargo.toml` file under the "dependencies" section the following:
```
sequel = "0.2.0"
```

then call as any other dependency:
